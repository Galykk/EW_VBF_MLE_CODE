Added note: This was my first interaction with plotting graphs with ROOT, so I made a file per histogram created. There are obviously better ways to do this but it was helpful as I was learning

The scale factor for the post fit is creating by dividing the post fit
 parameter by the initial MC events for that class of events.  If the fit
 is modified change these values to get the correct fit.
 
 - There is currently no legend implementd in these graph
